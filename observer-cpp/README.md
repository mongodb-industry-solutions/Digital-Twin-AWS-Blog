# Observer-CPP

A simple C++ application using the Realm C++ SDK to connect to the Atlas backend. If it finds a vehicle document with the configured VIN, it will start listening for changes and print out to console. The functionality is currently very simplistic and rather considered a foundation to add more specific functionality in the future.
